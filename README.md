# Coursera-Deep-Learning

I am learning Deep Learning from Coursera by Stanford Professor Dr. Andrew NG.

Course Curriculum is very good.

He teach the neural networks from scratch and we need to implement the NN, CNN, RNN from scratch in python using numpy.

The programming assignments are really good.

Hoping to complete it as soon as possible.

Thank you.
